# Fruit-Maturity-Detection-using-MATLAB-Image-Processing
The point of this paper is to build up an effective classification approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for early fruit maturity detection. Four fruits; i.e., Banana, Strawberry, grape and cherry were analyzed and a several features were extracted based on the fruit parameters.
